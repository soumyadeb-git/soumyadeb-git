## Professional Overview

I am a **Full-Stack Engineer** with a strong foundation in **data engineering and system design**.  
My work focuses on building **scalable applications**, designing **robust APIs**, and creating **data pipelines** that support real-world production workloads.

**Core principles I work by:**
- Clear architecture over shortcuts  
- Performance as a first-class concern  
- Long-term maintainability  
- Measurable impact through clean code and data
